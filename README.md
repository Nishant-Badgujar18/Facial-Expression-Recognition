# Facial-expression-recognition

* This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks.
* The model is trained on the dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).
* This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

# Installation:

1. Clone Respository

    ```makefile
    $ git clone https://github.com/Nishant-Badgujar18/Facial-expression-recognition.git
    ```
    
2. **OpenCV:** This is one of the libraries which is widely used in processing images, particularly real time images.

    ```makefile
    $ pip install opencv-python
    ```
    
3. **Keras:** This is one of the libraries which is used to code deep learning models. In its back-end it uses TensorFlow.

    ```makefile
    $ pip install keras
    ```
    
4. **Tensorflow:** TensorFlow provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models using Python or JavaScript

    ```makefile
    $ pip3 install tensorflow
    ```
    
# Run

-   Just run main.py file with proper paths of haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and model.h5 files

    ```makefile
    $ python3 main.py
    ```
