# Facial-expression-recognition

* This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks.
* The model is trained on the dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).
* This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

2. **OpenCV:** This is one of the libraries which is widely used in processing images, particularly real time images.

    ```makefile
    $ pip install opencv-python
    ```
    
3. **Keras:** This is one of the libraries which is used to code deep learning models. In its back-end it uses TensorFlow.
